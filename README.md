# Project-Documentation
This repository contains the data analytics project development lifecycle and template along with notes on how to keep the documentation of data analytics projects.


The standard lifecycle of a data analytics project typically involves several stages. Although the specific steps may vary depending on the organization and project requirements, the following are common phases in the data analytics project lifecycle:

## Project Initiation:

- Define the project objectives and scope.
- Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
- Formulate the project team and assign roles and responsibilities.
- Assess the feasibility and potential value of the project.

## Data Collection and Preparation:

- Identify the data sources required for the analysis.
- Collect and gather relevant data from various sources.
- Cleanse, validate, and transform the data to ensure its quality and usability.
- Perform data integration, if necessary, to combine data from multiple sources.

## Data Exploration and Analysis:

- Explore the data to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships.
- Apply descriptive and exploratory analytics techniques to gain insights.
- Use statistical analysis and data visualization to identify trends and correlations.
- Develop and refine hypotheses to guide further analysis.

## Model Development and Implementation:

- Select appropriate data modelling and analysis techniques based on project objectives.
- Build predictive models, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical models.
- Validate and fine-tune the models using appropriate methodologies.
- Implement the models into the data analytics system or platform.

## Result Interpretation and Reporting:

- Analyze the model outputs and interpret the results in the context of the project objectives.
- Derive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the analysis.
- Prepare reports, dashboards, or visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
- Present the results to stakeholders and engage in discussions to drive decision-making.

## Deployment and Monitoring:

- Implement the recommended solutions or strategies derived from the analysis.
- Monitor the performance of the deployed solution and track key metrics.
- Continuously assess and refine the models and methodologies used.
- Address any issues or challenges that arise during the deployment phase.

## Project Closure and Evaluation:

- Evaluate the project's success against the defined objectives.
- Review the lessons learned and document best practices.
- Conduct a post-implementation review to assess the impact of the project.
- Provide recommendations for future projects or enhancements.

It's important to note that the data analytics project lifecycle is iterative and may involve iterations or feedback loops between different stages as new insights are discovered or project requirements evolve.

#### To design a project pipeline to streamline the data collection, data transformation and data loading for the Tableau data visualization dashboard process with the help of MS Excel, Python, and Tableau resources  

* Designing a project pipeline to streamline the data collection, transformation, and loading process for Tableau data visualization can involve integrating MS Excel, Python, and Tableau resources.
* Here's a step-by-step guide to help you design the pipeline:

## Define the Data Requirements:

- Determine the data sources needed for your Tableau visualizations.
- Identify the specific data elements, formats, and structures required.
- Define the frequency and method of data collection.

## Data Collection:

- Use MS Excel to manually collect data or import data from external sources.
- Develop automated processes using Python to fetch data from APIs, databases, or other sources.
- Ensure data integrity and accuracy during the collection process.

## Data Transformation and Cleaning:

- Analyze the collected data in MS Excel to identify inconsistencies, errors, or missing values.
- Develop Python scripts to automate data cleaning, transformation, and standardization tasks.
- Utilize Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and cleansing operations.

## Data Loading and Storage:

- Define the data storage structure based on the data requirements and size.
- Use Python to load transformed data into a database, data warehouse, or other storage systems.
- Ensure appropriate indexing and partitioning for efficient querying.

## Data Extraction for Tableau:

- Use Python to extract the required data from the storage system in the desired format.
- Convert the data to a format compatible with Tableau, such as CSV, Excel, or a database query.
- Automate the extraction process to ensure up-to-date data availability.

## Tableau Visualization:

- Import the extracted data into Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server.
- Develop interactive dashboards, visualizations, and reports using Tableau's drag-and-drop interface.
- Apply appropriate visualizations, filters, and calculations to effectively communicate insights.

## Automation and Scheduled Refresh:

- Set up automated workflows using tools like Python's scheduling libraries or task schedulers.
- Schedule data collection, transformation, and loading processes to occur at regular intervals.
- Configure Tableau to refresh data connections or reports automatically.

## Monitoring and Maintenance:

- Monitor the pipeline for any errors, inconsistencies, or performance issues.
- Implement logging and error-handling mechanisms in Python scripts.
- Regularly review and update the pipeline as new data sources or requirements emerge.

** Note: Remember to consider security and privacy measures throughout the pipeline, such as encryption, access controls, and data anonymization if required. Additionally, ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations and organizational policies.

By designing a well-structured pipeline, you can streamline the data collection, transformation, and loading process, enabling you to efficiently visualize data in Tableau and derive valuable insights.
