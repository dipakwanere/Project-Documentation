## [ Project Name ]: Customer Performance and Utilization

The standard lifecycle of a data analytics project typically involves several stages. Although the specific steps may vary depending on the organization and project requirements, 
the following are common phases in the data analytics project lifecycle:

1. Project Initiation:
    - Define the project objectives and scope. (This is the project to track the resource allocation for the entire department. where the initial implementation will start from the first 1 customer and then it will be 
implemented for the other remaining customers.)
    - Identify stakeholders and their requirements. (All the management people and senior managers along with directors and senior director )
    - Formulate the project team and assign roles and responsibilities.  
[
    * Current team consist of only 1 member and along the way data handling team and viz team will get included.

 ]
    - Assess the feasibility and potential value of the project. ( objective is to track whether the business resource utilisation is going in the right direction or if is there any requirement for resources.)

2. Data Collection and Preparation:
    - Identify the data sources required for the analysis. (One-Drive Folder Location is the data source)
    - Collect and gather relevant data from various sources.  (There is only one data source.)
    - Cleanse, validate, and transform the data to ensure its quality and usability.

    * Required columns will be very specific and so 
    * parameter required from the data - Customer_Name | Customer_Service_Type | Date | Received [data] | Completed [data] | working hours | total data | etc. 

]
    - Perform data integration, if necessary, to combine data from multiple sources.

3. Data Exploration and Analysis:
    - Explore the data to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships.
    - Apply descriptive and exploratory analytics techniques to gain insights.
    - Use statistical analysis and data visualization to identify trends and correlations.
    - Develop and refine hypotheses to guide further analysis.

4. Model Development and Implementation:
    - Select appropriate data modelling and analysis techniques based on project objectives.
    - Build predictive models, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical models.
    - Validate and fine-tune the models using appropriate methodologies.
    - Implement the models into the data analytics system or platform.

5. Results Interpretation and Reporting:
    - Analyze the model outputs and interpret the results in the context of the project objectives.
    - Derive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the analysis.
    - Prepare reports, dashboards, or visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
    - Present the results to stakeholders and engage in discussions to drive decision-making.

6. Deployment and Monitoring:
    - Implement the recommended solutions or strategies derived from the analysis.
    - Monitor the performance of the deployed solution and track key metrics.
    - Continuously assess and refine the models and methodologies used.
    - Address any issues or challenges that arise during the deployment phase.

7. Project Closure and Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the project's success against the defined objectives.
    - Review the lessons learned and document best practices.
    - Conduct a post-implementation review to assess the impact of the project.
    - Provide recommendations for future projects or enhancements.

It's important to note that the data analytics project lifecycle is iterative and may involve iterations or feedback loops between different stages as new insights are discovered or project requirements evolve.
